# Expo Image Component Local URI Loading Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to the Expo `Image` component's handling of local image URIs.  The bug manifests as a failure to load images from local storage, resulting in a vague error message.

The solution involves careful verification of the image URI, ensuring it points to a valid, accessible image file within the application's assets.  Additionally, confirming the URI format and the component's configuration to properly handle local file paths is critical.

This issue highlights the importance of precise URI handling when using local images with Expo.
