The solution involves double-checking the URI path, ensuring it's correct and points to an existing file. Also, verify the file is accessible within the Expo app's context.  If using a relative path, make sure it's relative to the correct directory.  If the image is part of the project's assets, make sure it is properly included. 

Here's an example showing a corrected way to use the `Image` component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Image } from 'expo-image';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const imagePath = require('./assets/myimage.jpg'); // Correct way to import local image
  return (
    <Image source={{ uri: imagePath }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Avoid using relative paths unless absolutely necessary, as they can be problematic and lead to unpredictable behavior.
